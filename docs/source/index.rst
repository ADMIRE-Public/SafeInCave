Salt cavern simulations made easy!
==================================

The **SafeInCave** is a 3D finite element simulator for the geomechanics of gas storage in salt caverns.
The simulator is developed in Python and it uses `FEniCS 2019.1 
<https://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/ufl/en/2019.1.0/manual/examples.html>`_ 
for the finite element implementation.


Check out the :doc:`introduction` section for further information.
