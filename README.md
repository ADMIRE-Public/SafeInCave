# Introduction
The SafeInCave simulator is developed for simulating the mechanics of salt caverns for storage operations. The finite element implementation uses the FEniCS package. Additionally, it includes different constitutive models for salt rock mechanics. 

## Getting started
The user should start by reading the documentation at folder docs/manual. There you will find the installation steps, simple to complex tutorials, and detailed instructions on how to setup your own simulation cases. In addition, check out our video lectures on the SafeInCave simulator:

1) Tensorial operations (theory): https://youtu.be/w5KX3F_rdzU?si=QQLVBq1NcrvOiS32
2) Tensorial operations (exercises): https://youtu.be/JiN6jwp0RPk?si=K1Qhe3lAxJD4LI5w
3) SafeInCave installation: https://youtu.be/J0KQ-nBMwwU?si=VXUVk60yrxavfT1E
4) Stay tuned for upcoming video lectures.
